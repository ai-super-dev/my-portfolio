                <h3>Relevant legal bases</h3>
                <p>The following is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection requirements may apply in your or our country of residence or residence. Should more specific legal bases also apply in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for a specific purpose or several specific purposes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Contract fulfilment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures carried out at the request of the data subject.</li>
                  <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany</strong>: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, there are national regulations on data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act — BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right of objection, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. It also regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. In addition, the data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
                <h2>Safety Measures</h2>
                <p>In accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
                <p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, entry, transfer, assurance of availability and separation relating to it. We have also set up procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to the data being endangered. In addition, we take the protection of personal data into account when developing or selecting hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through privacy-friendly default settings.</p>
                <p><strong>IP address shortening</strong>: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a full IP address is not required, the IP address is abbreviated (also known as “IP masking”). This removes the last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a dot or replaces them with placeholders. The abbreviation of the IP address is intended to prevent or significantly complicate the identification of a person based on their IP address.</p>
                <p><strong>SSL encryption (https)</strong>: To protect your data transmitted via our online offering, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https://in the address line of your browser.</p>
                <h2>Transfer of personal data</h2>
                <p>As part of our processing of personal data, the data may be transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such a case, we comply with legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>
                <h2>Data processing in third countries</h2>
                <p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place as part of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this is only done in accordance with legal requirements. </p>
                <p>Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we only process or allow data to be processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, when certifications or binding internal data protection regulations exist (Articles 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de</a>).</p>
                <h2>Deletion of data</h2>
                <p>The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as their permitted consent for processing is revoked or other permits no longer apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not necessary for the purpose).</p>
                <p>If the data is not deleted because it is necessary for other and legally permitted purposes, its processing will be limited to these purposes. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</p>
                <p>As part of our privacy policy, we can provide users with further information about the deletion and storage of data that applies specifically to the respective processing process.</p>
                <h2>Use of cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user&#x27;s computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after their visit to an online offering. The stored information may include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping cart or the location where a video was watched. The term cookies also includes other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g. when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also known as “user IDs”)</p>
                <p><strong>A distinction is made between the following types of cookies and functions:</strong></p>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li><strong>Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed their browser.</li>
                  <li><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. The interests of users who are used to measure reach or for marketing purposes can also be stored in such a cookie.</li>
                  <li><strong>First-party cookies:</strong> First-party cookies are set by ourselves.</li>
                  <li><strong>Third party cookies (also: third-party cookies)</strong>: Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.</li>
                  <li><strong>Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:</strong> On the one hand, cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to save logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).</li>
                  <li><strong>Statistics, marketing and personalization cookies</strong>: In addition, cookies are usually also used as part of reach measurement and when a user&#x27;s interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) are stored in a user profile on individual websites. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that corresponds to their potential interests. This process is also known as “tracking”, i.e. tracking the potential interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or “tracking” technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or as part of obtaining consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases: </strong>The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is your consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in operating our online offering and improving it) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.</p>
                <p><strong>Storage period: </strong>Unless we provide you with explicit information on the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. as part of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period can be up to two years.</p>
                <p><strong>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out): </strong>Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to withdraw your consent or to object to the processing of your data using cookie technologies (collectively referred to as “opt-out”). You can first declare your objection using your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (which may also restrict the functionality of our online offering). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be made using a variety of services, in particular in the case of tracking, via the websites <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">https://optout.aboutads.info</a>and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> be explained. In addition, you may receive further objection information as part of the information about the service providers and cookies used.</p>
                <p><strong>Processing cookie data based on consent</strong>: We use a cookie consent management process, in which users&#x27; consent to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned as part of the cookie consent management process, can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. In this case, the declaration of consent is stored so that you do not have to repeat the request again and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can be done on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or using comparable technologies) in order to be able to assign consent to a user or his device. Subject to individual information on providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The period of storage of consent may be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created and, with the time of consent, information on the scope of consent (e.g. which categories of cookies and/or service providers) and the browser, system and device used is stored.</p>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
                  <li><strong>Affected persons:</strong> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
                  <li><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Consent (Article 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. a. GDPR), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Provision of online services and web hosting</h2>
                <p>In order to be able to provide our online offering securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers, from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, as well as security services and technical maintenance services.</p>
                <p>The data processed as part of the provision of the hosting service may include all information relating to users of our online service that is generated in the course of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to deliver the content of online offers to browsers, and all entries made within our online offering or from websites.</p>
                <p><strong>Collection of access data and log files</strong>: We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data about every access to the server (so-called server log files). The server log files may include the address and name of the accessed websites and files, date and time of access, amounts of data transferred, notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user&#x27;s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.</p>
                <p>The server log files can be used on the one hand for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (in particular in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and, on the other hand, to ensure the utilization of the servers and their stability.</p>
                <p><strong>Content delivery network</strong>: We use a “content delivery network” (CDN). A CDN is a service that allows content from an online offering, in particular large media files, such as graphics or program scripts, to be delivered faster and more securely using regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet.</p>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Content data (e.g. entries in online forms), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
                  <li><strong>Affected persons:</strong> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>

                <h2>Video conferences, online meetings, webinars and screen sharing</h2>
                <p>We use platforms and applications from other providers (hereinafter referred to as “conference platforms”) for the purpose of conducting video and audio conferences, webinars and other types of video and audio meetings (hereinafter collectively referred to as “conference”). When selecting conference platforms and their services, we comply with legal requirements. </p>
                <p><strong>Data processed through conference platforms:</strong> When participating in a conference, the conference platforms process the personal data of the participants mentioned below. The scope of processing depends, on the one hand, on which data is required during a specific conference (e.g. provision of login details or real names) and what optional information is provided by the participants. In addition to processing to hold the conference, participants&#x27; data can also be processed by the conference platforms for security purposes or service optimization. The processed data includes personal data (first name, last name), contact information (e-mail address, telephone number), access data (access codes or passwords), profile pictures, information on professional position/function, the IP address of Internet access, information about the participants&#x27; devices, their operating system, the browser and its technical and language settings, information on the content of communication processes, i.e. inputs into chats and audio and video data, as well as the use of others available standing functions (e.g. surveys). The content of communications is encrypted to the extent technically provided by the conference providers. If the participants are registered as users of the conference platforms, then further data can be processed in accordance with the agreement with the respective conference provider.</p>
                <p><strong>Logging and Recording:</strong> If text entries, participation results (e.g. from surveys) and video or audio recordings are recorded, this will be transparently notified to the participants in advance and, if necessary, they will be asked for their consent.</p>
                <p><strong>Participants&#x27; data protection measures:</strong> Please note their privacy policies for the details of the processing of your data by the conference platforms and, as part of the settings on the conference platforms, select the security and data protection settings that are optimal for you. Please also ensure data and privacy protection in the background of your recording for the duration of a video conference (e.g. by notifying roommates, locking doors and using, as far as technically possible, the function to obscure the background). Links to the conference rooms and login details may not be passed on to unauthorised third parties.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If, in addition to conference platforms, we also process users&#x27; data and ask users for their consent to use the conference platforms or certain functions (e.g. consent to recording conferences), the legal basis for processing is this consent. Furthermore, our processing may be necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations (e.g. in participant lists, in the case of processing interview results, etc.). In addition, users&#x27; data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests in efficient and secure communication with our communication partners.</p>

                <h2>Cloud Services</h2>
                <p>We use software services accessible via the Internet and executed on the servers of their providers (so-called “cloud services”, also known as “software as a service”) for the following purposes: document storage and administration, calendar management, email delivery, spreadsheets and presentations, exchange of documents, content and information with specific recipients or publication of websites, forms or other content and information, as well as chats and participation in audio and video conferences.</p>
                <p>In this context, personal data may be processed and stored on the providers&#x27; servers, insofar as this is part of communication processes with us or otherwise processed by us, as set out in this privacy policy. This data may include, in particular, master data and contact details of users, data on processes, contracts, other processes and their content. The providers of cloud services also process usage data and metadata, which are used by them for security purposes and to optimize services.</p>
                <p>If we use cloud services to provide forms or documents and content to other users or publicly available websites, providers can store cookies on users&#x27; devices for web analysis purposes or to remember user settings (e.g. in the case of media control).</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If we ask for consent to use cloud services, the legal basis for processing is consent. Furthermore, their use may be part of our (pre) contractual services, provided that the use of cloud services has been agreed within this framework. Otherwise, users&#x27; data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient and secure administrative and collaboration processes)</p>

                </ul>
                <h2>Newsletters and Electronic Notifications</h2>
                <p>We only send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter “newsletters”) with the consent of the recipients or legal permission. If, as part of a subscription to the newsletter, its content is specifically described, they are decisive for the consent of the users. In addition, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.</p>
                <p>To subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your e-mail address. However, we can ask you to provide a name for personal contact in the newsletter, or other information, if this is necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.</p>
                <p><strong>Double opt-in process:</strong> Registration for our newsletter is generally carried out in a so-called double opt-in process. This means that after registration, you will receive an email asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log in with foreign email addresses. Newsletter registrations are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process in accordance with legal requirements. This includes saving the time of registration and confirmation as well as the IP address. Changes to your data stored by the shipping service provider are also logged.</p>
                <p><strong>Deletion and restriction of processing: </strong>We can store the omitted email addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to prove a previously given consent. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the event of obligations to comply with objections on a permanent basis, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a blacklist (so-called “block list”) for this purpose alone.</p>
                <p>The registration process is logged on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving that it has been properly completed. If we commission a service provider to send emails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure delivery system.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> The newsletters are sent on the basis of the consent of the recipients or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing, if and to the extent that this is permitted by law, e.g. in the case of advertising to existing customers. If we commission a service provider to send emails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests. The registration process is recorded based on our legitimate interests to prove that it was carried out in accordance with the law.</p>
                <p>Content: Information about us, our services, promotions and offers.</p>
                <p><strong>Measurement of open and click rates</strong>: The newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a shipping service provider, from its server. As part of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval, is first collected. </p>
                <p>This information is used to technically improve our newsletter based on technical data or target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. This information is assigned to individual newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until deleted. The evaluations help us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content in accordance with the interests of our users.</p>
                <p>The measurement of opening rates and click rates as well as storage of measurement results in users&#x27; profiles and their further processing are carried out on the basis of user consent. </p>

                <h2>Web analysis, monitoring and optimization</h2>
                <p>Web analysis (also known as “reach measurement”) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to our online offering and can include behavior, interests or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of reach analysis, we can, for example, identify at what time our online offering or its functions or content are used most frequently or invite them to be reused. We can also understand which areas require optimization. </p>
                <p>In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures, for example to test and optimize different versions of our online offering or its components.</p>
                <p>For these purposes, so-called user profiles can be created and stored in a file (so-called “cookie”) or similar processes can be used for the same purpose. This information may include, for example, viewed content, websites visited and elements used there, and technical information, such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this may also be processed, depending on the provider.</p>
                <p>Users&#x27; IP addresses are also stored. However, we use an IP masking process (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, as part of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, user data (such as email addresses or names) is not stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers of the software used do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, users&#x27; data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>
                <p><strong>VG Wort/Scalable central measurement method</strong>: We use “session cookies” from VG Wort, Munich, to measure access to texts in order to determine the probability of copying. Session cookies are small pieces of information that a provider stores in the memory of the visitor&#x27;s computer. A randomly generated unique identification number, a so-called session ID, is stored in a session cookie. A cookie also contains information about its origin and the storage period. Session cookies cannot store any other data. These measurements are carried out by Kantar Germany GmbH using the Scalable Central Measurement Method (SZM). They help to determine the likelihood of individual texts being copied to compensate for legal claims by authors and publishers. We do not collect any personal information via cookies.</p>
                <p>The scalable central measurement method collects anonymous measurement values. To recognize computer systems, the access number measurement alternatively uses a session cookie or a signature, which is created from various automatically transmitted information from your browser. IP addresses are only processed anonymously. The process was developed with data protection in mind. The sole aim of the process is to determine the likelihood of individual texts being copied. At no time are individual users identified. Your identity is always protected. You will not receive any advertising through the system.</p>

                <h2>Online Marketing</h2>
                <p>We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include, in particular, the marketing of advertising space or presentation of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as “content”) based on potential interests of users and the measurement of its effectiveness. </p>
                <p>For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called “cookie”) or similar processes are used to store the user information relevant to the presentation of the aforementioned content. This information may include, for example, viewed content, websites visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information, such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this can also be processed.</p>
                <p>Users&#x27; IP addresses are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, as part of the online marketing process, no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of online marketing processes, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.</p>
                <p>The information in the profiles is usually stored in cookies or using similar procedures. These cookies can generally also be read and analyzed for the purpose of displaying content on other websites that use the same online marketing process, as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing process provider.</p>
                <p>As an exception, clear data can be assigned to profiles. This is the case if, for example, users are members of a social network whose online marketing process we use and the network combines users&#x27; profiles with the above information. Please note that users can make additional agreements with providers, e.g. by giving consent as part of registration.</p>
                <p>In principle, we only have access to summarized information about the success of our advertisements. However, as part of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e. to the conclusion of a contract with us, for example. Conversion measurement is used solely to analyze the success of our marketing measures.</p>
                <p>Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, users&#x27; data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services).

With the Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags), for example, no user profiles are created or cookies are saved. Google only learns the user&#x27;s IP address, which is necessary to run Google Tag Manager.

                  <li><strong>Google Ads and conversion measurement:</strong> We use the online marketing process “Google Ads” to place ads on the Google advertising network (e.g., in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are displayed to users who have a presumed interest in the ads. We also measure the conversion of ads. However, we only know the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page with a so-called “conversion tracking tag”. However, we ourselves do not receive any information that can be used to identify users.

                <h2>Affiliate programs and affiliate links</h2>
                <p>In our online offering, we include so-called affiliate links or other references (which may include, for example, search masks, widgets or discount codes) to the offers and services of third-party providers (collectively referred to as “affiliate links”). If users follow the affiliate links or then take advantage of the offers, we may receive a commission or other benefits from these third-party providers (collectively referred to as “commission”).</p>
                <p>In order to be able to track whether users have taken advantage of the offers of an affiliate link used by us, it is necessary for the respective third-party providers to know that the users have followed an affiliate link used within our online offering. The attribution of affiliate links to the respective business transactions or to other promotions (e.g. purchases) is for the sole purpose of commission billing and is removed as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of assigning affiliate links above, the affiliate links can be supplemented with certain values that are part of the link or can be stored in another way, e.g. in a cookie. The values may include, in particular, the source website (referrer), the time, an online ID of the operator of the website on which the affiliate link was located, an online identifier of the respective offer, the type of link used, the type of offer and an online identifier of the user.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Furthermore, their use may be part of our (pre) contractual services, provided that the use of third-party providers has been agreed within this framework. Otherwise, users&#x27; data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>Presences in social networks (social media)</h2>
                <p>We maintain online presences within social networks and, within this framework, process user data in order to communicate with users active there or to offer information about us.</p>
                <p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the area of the European Union. This may result in risks for users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce users&#x27; rights.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on users&#x27; computers, which store users&#x27; usage behavior and interests. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the usage profiles independently of the devices used by the users (in particular if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).</p>
                <p>For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the options for objection (opt-out), we refer to the privacy policies and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.</p>
                <p>Even in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only providers have access to users&#x27; data and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. Should you still need help, you can contact us.</p>

                <h2>Plug-ins and embedded features and content</h2>
                <p>We integrate functional and content elements into our online offering, which are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as “third-party providers”). This may include graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”).</p>
                <p>Integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the users&#x27; IP address, as they would not be able to send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required to display this content or functions. We strive to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information, such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user&#x27;s device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, the time of visit and further information on the use of our online offering, as well as be linked to such information from other sources.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, users&#x27; data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Integration of third-party software, scripts or frameworks (e.g. jQuery)</strong>: We integrate software into our online offering that we retrieve from servers of other providers (e.g. functional libraries that we use to present or make our online offer user-friendly). In doing so, the respective providers collect the users&#x27; IP address and can process it for the purpose of transmitting the software to the users&#x27; browser and for security purposes, as well as to evaluate and optimize their offering.</p>
