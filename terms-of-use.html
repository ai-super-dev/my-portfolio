For more information, there is a list on the main page under FAQs!<br><br><strong>c. Unlimited changes: <br></strong>We offer unlimited changes in accordance with our terms. That means we&#x27;ll keep making adjustments to a specific design project until you&#x27;re satisfied. However, this iritation takes more days and should be considered.

                <p><strong>a. How the pause function works:<br></strong>Our billing cycles are based on a 30-day period. For example, if you only use our service for 20 days and then decide to take a break, the billing cycle will stop. You can use the remaining 10 days that you have left at a later date whenever it is convenient for you.<br><br><strong>b. Activate the pause function in the Trelloboard:<br></strong>To activate the pause feature, move the “PAUSE” card to the “Ready” column. There shouldn&#x27;t be a project in the “In Progress” or “For Approval” columns at this time. The activation of the pause function will be confirmed as soon as we move the “PAUSE” card to the “In process” column. This ensures that the pause function is planned and implemented in our work process and procedure. The pause feature only works in Trello. The function of interruption via Stripe&#x27;s customer portal is not permitted and cannot be performed by us as a result of the processes.<br><br><strong>c. Duration and applicability:<br></strong>The pause function can be activated for a minimum period of 7 days. There is no maximum limit on the duration of the pause function as long as you have the days left over from your current billing cycle. The pause function cannot be activated 7 days before the end of the next cancellation cycle.<br><br><strong>d. Resumption of services:<br></strong>To resume service after a break, remove the “PAUSE” card and place a new or existing task card in the “Ready” column. Your subscription will then resume the following day, taking into account the remaining days from your interrupted billing cycle.</p>
